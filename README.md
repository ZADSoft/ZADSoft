## Welcome To ZAD Software Systems ðŸ‘‹

I've been a Senior Software Developer for some 30 years working in many different development languages and across many different business sectors including:

+ Accounting Systems - Ledgers / Stock Control / Production Control (BOM) / Payroll
+ Marketing / Project Management / Sourcing Systems
+ Auto ID & RFID Systems for everything from Production Line tracking to Warehouse and GPS tracking etc
+ International Freight Forwarding systems for Sea and Air Freight
+ Computer Aided Despatch Systems for the Emergency Services
+ Not to mention the obilgatory Web Site stuff many of us get involved in
+ Private contract work when the occasion rises

Being a full stack developer my primary development languages these days are VB.Net and C#; SQL server databases; throw in supporting technologies like HTML / ASP.Net / Javascript / XML / JSON / CSS etc. But always trying to learn as that is what us Engineers do.

I'm new on GitHub (2024) as projects I've contributed to over the years have slowly moved over here so about time I did too. I'll also be slowing moving some of my own stuff over here and making some Public.
